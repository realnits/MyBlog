  In this post, we’ll break down why busywork generators are low-leverage security solutions, how they create noise instead of fixing root causes, and how to move toward high-leverage mechanisms like platform guardrails and secure-by-default designs.
---

### Scenario

You’re part of an AppSec team rolling out a new security scanner. You expect better coverage, but instead you get resistance from developers, alert fatigue in your triage team, and a growing backlog of unresolved findings. The root issue? You’ve deployed a **busywork generator**.

### What Busywork Generators Do

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Pattern** | Alert-heavy, outcome-light tools |
| **Problem** | False positives, manual triage, unresolved alerts |
| **Impact** | Burnout, friction, wasted time |

Security tools that push alerts **without fixing the root issue** often end up creating more work than value. You’re just moving the problem downstream.

> “Just raise a ticket” ≠ Fix.

### Symptoms of Busywork Generators

- Security tooling that creates issues but doesn’t help resolve them.
- Manual triage becomes a full-time job.
- False positives are common, and real issues are buried.
- Developer trust erodes. “Security is just creating noise.”

### Dig Deeper — Ask “Why?”

Instead of patching symptoms, trace the root cause using the **5 Whys** approach:

- Why did this alert trigger?
- Why wasn’t the default secure?
- Why wasn’t it caught earlier?
- Why was the responsibility misaligned?

Most root issues stem from:

- Lack of **secure defaults**
- Missing platform **guardrails**
- Poor integration into existing workflows

### Shortridge’s Ice Cream Cone Model

Visualize your detection layers as an **ice cream cone**:

- Top = Built-in controls (secure by default)
- Middle = Automated checks (CI/CD, integrations)
- Bottom = Human effort (manual review, triage)

Busywork generators focus on the bottom layer. **Shift up**.

### “Get Clean” vs “Stay Clean”

| Goal | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Get Clean** | Fix immediate issues |
| **Stay Clean** | Prevent issues long-term via guardrails |

Don't aim for perfect cleanup. Just fix what matters and build mechanisms to stay clean.

### Case Study – GitHub Actions Incident

An attacker compromised the popular `tj-actions` GitHub Action due to unpinned tags.

Root issue: **No default enforcement for SHA-pinning**.

Real fix:

- Proactively scan repos.
- Alert and enforce pinned versions in CI pipelines.
- Help devs stay secure by default.

### Fix the System, Not Just the Symptoms

Avoid "NagOps" (constant reminders, trainings, ticket spam).

Instead, build **mechanisms**:

- Secure-by-default templates
- Platform-level controls and auto-enforcement
- CI/CD feedback loops with clear context

### Final Thoughts

Busywork looks productive but creates burnout. Real security outcomes come from systemic, embedded solutions.
